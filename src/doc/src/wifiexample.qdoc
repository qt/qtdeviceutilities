    \section1 Importing NetworkSettings

    Import the NetworkSettings module as follows:
    \badcode
    import QtDeviceUtilities.NetworkSettings 1.0
    \endcode

    \section1 Filtering WiFi Networks

    In order to connect to WiFi instead of wired networks, set
    NetworkSettingsManager in a WiFi filtering mode:

    \badcode
    Component.onCompleted: NetworkSettingsManager.services.type = NetworkSettingsType.Wifi;
    \endcode

    After you have set the filter, \l{NetworkSettingsManager::services}{NetworkSettingsManager.services} contains
    the NetworkService objects services representing WiFi networks.

    \section1 Connecting to WiFi

    In order to connect to Wifi, invoke the
    \l{NetworkService::connectService()}{connectService} method on NetworkService.

    If no passphrase is needed, \l{NetworkService::connectService()}{connectService}
    connects to a WiFi network and changes the connected property of the selected service.

    If a passphrase is needed, NetworkSettingsManager.userAgent
    emits the \l{NetworkSettingsManager::userAgent.showUserCredentialsInput}{showUserCredentialsInput} signal.
    Before a WiFi network is connected, you must provide the passphrase via
    \l{NetworkSettingsManager::userAgent.setPassphrase}{NetworkSettingsManager.userAgent.setPassPhrase}.

    To implement the passphrase handling, you must set a signal handler as follows:
    \badcode
            Connections {
                target: NetworkSettingsManager.userAgent
                onShowUserCredentialsInput : {
                // obtain the passphrase and set it
                }
                onError: {
                // handle errors
                }
            }
    \endcode

    \section1 Implementing User Interface

    When you are implementing a user interface for handling WiFi connections,
    remember that \l{NetworkSettingsManager::services}{NetworkSettingsManager.services}
    is designed to be used as a model. The \l{Settings UI} implementation
    uses it directly to display a list of available WiFi networks.

    Handling WiFi connections and passphrases for list selections
    should be straightforward as described in \l{Filtering WiFi Networks} and
    \l{Connecting to WiFi}.
